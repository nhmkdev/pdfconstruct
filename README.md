# PdfConstruct

PdfConstruct is basic application for combining images into a single PDF. Each image is placed onto a new "page" in the PDF.

## Instructions

### Building a PDF From Images

This is just a quick guide... lots more information pending.

* Add/Tweak cards by right-clicking in the list view. Multi-select applies to a number of the functions.
* Be sure to get the DPI correct. This determines the size of the pages.
* You can save/load your project via the File menu.

### Merging Two PDFs (interleaving)

* Switch to the `PDF Merge/Interleave Util` tab and fill in the inputs. 

NOTE: When you exit you may be prompted to save any changes (assuming you are not using any other functionality it is safe to ignore this).

## Special Thanks
