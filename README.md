# PdfConstruct

PdfConstruct is basic application for combining images into a single PDF. Each image is placed onto a new "page" in the PDF.

## Instructions

This is just a quick guide... lots more information pending.

* Add/Tweak cards by right-clicking in the list view. Multi-select applies to a number of the functions.
* Be sure to get the DPI correct. This determines the size of the pages.
* You can save/load your project via the File menu.

## Special Thanks
